Values for (1, 000, 000, 000) were unobtainable because the value is too large for the assembly. I used (1, 000, 000, 00) instead to compare values.

We are able to notice that whenever we increase the array size, the runtime increases which is logical since it has to go through more iterations.
Furthermore, we can also deduce that when we increase the number of threads, in most cases, the runtime decreases. This is because the work is being divided among 
different processing units. However, we tend to see that at a certain point adding more threads does not significantly improve performance. 
For array size,we sometimes see that a larger array with a specific number of threads runs better this may be due to good load balancing among threads and thus leads to better
utilization of resources and may potentially reduce runtime.
